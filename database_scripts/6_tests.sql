-- Test 3: Core Logic (sp_add_cart_item, Triggers, fn_get_cart_total)
-- =====================================
-- This tests the real-time assignment and pricing logic.

-- Customer 1 (Aarav) is in Mumbai (19.0760, 72.8777).
-- Pharmacy 1 (MedLife) is in Mumbai (18.9218, 72.8330) and is closest.

-- Step 1: Add Med 1 (Paracetamol) to Cart 1.
-- sp_add_cart_item will call sp_assign_single_cart_item.
-- Closest pharmacy with Med 1 is P1. Price = 20.00.
-- Trigger fires. Total = 2 * 20.00 = 40.00. Prescription = 0.
CALL sp_add_cart_item(1, 1, 2);

-- Verify Step 1:
SELECT total_amount, requires_prescription FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Check assigned_pharmacy_id = 1

-- Step 2: Add Med 2 (Amoxicillin) to Cart 1.
-- Closest pharmacy with Med 2 is P1. Price = 120.00.
-- Trigger fires. fn_get_cart_total now sums BOTH items:
-- (2 * 20.00) + (1 * 120.00) = 40.00 + 120.00 = 160.00
-- Prescription = 1 (because Med 2 requires it).
CALL sp_add_cart_item(1, 2, 1);

-- Verify Step 2:
-- EXPECTED: 160.00, 1 (TRUE)
SELECT total_amount, requires_prescription FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Both items assigned to P1


-- =====================================
-- Test 4: fn_check_medicine_availability (UNCHANGED)
-- =====================================
-- Check stock of Med 1 at P1 (should be 50 from reset)

-- Test 5: sp_process_cart_to_order_modular (Successful Order)
-- =====================================
-- This is a self-contained "happy path" test.
-- We'll use Cart 1 (Aarav, Mumbai), which is 'Paid'.
-- Pharmacy 1 (Mumbai) is closest.

-- Step 1: Add items to Cart 1.
-- P1 Price for Med 1 = 20.00
-- P1 Price for Med 2 = 120.00
CALL sp_add_cart_item(1, 1, 2); -- Qty 2, Assigns P1. Total = 40.00

-- Verify cart state before processing
SELECT * FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Expected Total: 160.00
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Both items assigned to P1

-- Step 2: Process the order.
-- sp_validate_cart_stock will run, find all items are in stock,
-- and do nothing. The order will be created with total 160.00.
CALL sp_process_cart_to_order_modular(1);

-- Step 3: Verify the order was created correctly
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE cust_id = 1 AND total_amount = 160.00;
SELECT * FROM Sub_Order WHERE pharmacy_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM Order_Medicine;

-- Step 4: Verify stock was deducted
-- P1 Med 1: 50 - 2 = 48
-- P1 Med 2: 5 - 1 = 4
SELECT * FROM Available_Stock WHERE pharmacy_id = 1 AND med_id IN (1, 2);

-- Step 5: Verify cart was cleared
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Should be empty
SELECT * FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Should show 0.00, 0


-- =====================================
-- Test 6: sp_validate_cart_stock (Re-assignment Success Test)
-- =====================================
-- We simulate a "race condition" where the *first* pharmacy runs out,
-- but the procedure *finds a new pharmacy* and fixes the cart.

-- Step 1: Add item to Cart 3 (Rahul, Kolkata), which is 'Paid'.
-- Closest pharmacy with Med 1 is P3 (Kolkata). Stock=30, Price=19.00
CALL sp_add_cart_item(3, 1, 5); -- Qty 5 is fine
SELECT * FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 3; -- Expected Total = 5 * 19.00 = 95.00
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 3; -- Assigned to P3

-- Step 2: Simulate stock running out at P3.
UPDATE Available_Stock SET current_stock = 2 WHERE pharmacy_id = 3 AND med_id = 1;

-- Step 3: Attempt to process the order.
CALL sp_process_cart_to_order_modular(3);

-- == VERIFICATION FOR TEST 6 ==
-- sp_validate_cart_stock should have run:
-- 1. Found Qty 5 > Stock 2 at P3.
-- 2. Searched for a new pharmacy.
-- 3. Found P2 (Bengaluru, Stock=40, Price=22.00) as the next-best.
-- 4. Re-assigned the item to P2.
-- 5. Recalculated the cart total: 5 * 22.00 = 110.00
-- 6. The main procedure continued and created the order with this NEW total.

-- Verify the order was created with the *new* total
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE cust_id = 3 AND total_amount = 110.00;

-- Verify the sub-order was created for P2 (the new pharmacy)
SELECT * FROM Sub_Order WHERE pharmacy_id = 2;

-- Verify P3's stock was NOT touched (still 2)
SELECT * FROM Available_Stock WHERE pharmacy_id = 3 AND med_id = 1;

-- Verify P2's stock WAS deducted (40 - 5 = 35)

-- =====================================
-- Test 7: sp_validate_cart_stock (Total Failure Test)
-- =====================================
-- We simulate a "race condition" where the item is
-- out of stock EVERYWHERE.

-- Step 1: Add an item to Cart 1 (Aarav, 'Paid').
-- (Cart 1 was cleared by Test 5, so it's fresh)
-- Closest pharmacy with Med 1 is P1. Stock=48, Price=20.00
CALL sp_add_cart_item(1, 1, 10); -- Request 10 units

UPDATE Available_Stock SET current_stock = 5 WHERE med_id = 1; -- Set all to 5
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
SELECT * FROM Available_Stock WHERE med_id = 1; -- Verify all stock is 5

-- Step 3: Attempt to process the order.
-- sp_validate_cart_stock will run:
-- 1. Find Qty 10 > Stock 5 at P1.
-- 2. Try to re-assign to P2... Qty 10 > Stock 5. Fail.
-- 3. Try to re-assign to P3... Qty 10 > Stock 5. Fail.
-- 4. Throw the final error.
--
-- EXPECTED: Error "Error: "Paracetamol" is out of stock..."
CALL sp_process_cart_to_order_modular(1);

-- == VERIFICATION FOR TEST 7 ==
-- Since the call failed, the cart should NOT have been cleared,
-- and no order should have been created.
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE cust_id = 1 AND total_amount = 200.00; -- 0 rows
SELECT * FROM Cart_Item WHERE cart_id = 1; -- 1 row (item still there)
SELECT * FROM Cart WHERE cart_id = 1; -- Total still 200.00


-- =====================================
-- Test 8: sp_assign_delivery_agent
-- =====================================
-- This test assumes Test 5 or Test 6 was successful and created a Sub_Order.
-- Let's find a sub_order_id that was created.
SET @sub_order_id = (SELECT sub_order_id FROM Sub_Order LIMIT 1);
SET @agent_id = (SELECT agent_id FROM Delivery_Agent WHERE status = 'Available' LIMIT 1);

-- Step 1: Verify agent and sub-order are unassigned

-- Step 2: Assign the agent
